# REST API

Develop a robust RESTful API using TypeScript, Express.js, and Mongoose for user authentication. Implement JWT-based access and refresh tokens for enhanced security. Create seamless integration with the frontend, resulting in a user-friendly project that demonstrates the synergy between frontend and backend development.

## User Interface (UI)
The UI component of the project includes:

- A user registration form
- Network requests to facilitate user registration
- A user login form
- Network requests to handle user login
- Network requests to retrieve the current user

Technologies used for the UI:

- Next.js for frontend framework
- SWR for data fetching
- Axios for making HTTP requests
- Zod for data validation
- react-hook-form for form handling

## API
The API component encompasses:

- Authentication mechanisms
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
- Utilization of various HTTP methods
- Implementation of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and refresh tokens for enhanced security

Technologies and tools used for the API:

- Node.js for server-side runtime
- Express for building the API
- MongoDB for data storage
- Typegoose for working with MongoDB in a strongly-typed manner
- Zod for data validation
- JWT for securing user authentication
- TypeScript for enhanced code readability and maintainability
